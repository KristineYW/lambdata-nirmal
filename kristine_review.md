Nirmal, your code looks great! 

I love that it's simple, clear, easy to follow, and the results are very straightforward. 
Teach me your ways! 

I would suggest, just for your own sake, to shorten your function name. 
The date splitting function has an extremely long name, so it may be more difficult for 
another user to call it for the first time. Also, the longer the name, the easier it is
to make spelling mistakes, etc.

That's it! 

This reviewer gives you a 3++!
